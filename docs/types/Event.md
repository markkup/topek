Description

Admins want to be able to publicize an event that is occurring in the future.  Users will see the event details and have the ability to respond whether they will attend.  In addition, users will be able to see other details of the event including:
- event title
- event description
- event date
- event start time/(optional) end time
- event location name and coordinates

Users will see the events listed on their Topic Feed.  Events will include an identifiable "Event" icon next to the event name.  When users select the event, they will see the event details.  They will see three choices of whether they are attending - Yes, No, Maybe.  They will be able to change this selection in some way.  They will also be able to add the event to their device calendar.  If they select the map/location, it will launch their device's mapping program.

Limitations
