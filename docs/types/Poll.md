Description
-----------
Admins want to be able to poll their constituency for answers to simple basic questions.  Poll questions have simple predetermined answers.  The results can be helpful to see the overall mood, opinion, etc. of the users.  Results of polls are often viewed in a pie or bar chart to get a pictorial display of the responses that make it easy to determine the outcome of the poll.  There are times when admins don't want the users to be able to see the results, yet most of the time they will probably make the results public.

Limitations
-----------
1. Polls will only allow for a single response.
2. Free responses are not allowed in the polls.
