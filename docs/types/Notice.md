1. Admin wants to be able to create a notification/notice for users to see.

3. Admin needs to be able to create the content of the notification including plain text, marked/decorated up text, etc.
4. User needs to be able to view the notification (can this be a different notification than the typical phone notification)?
5. User needs to be able to view the notification details.
6. User needs to be able to "dismiss" the notification.

Description
-----------
Admins want to be able to send simple notification information to the users in the organization. These notifications will be for various issues and can include normal, mundane information or for high-importance/emergency issues.  These notifications will be seen in the user's topic feed and they will be able to view the full details of the notice.  Users may not want to see the notice in their topic feed any more and the ability to dismiss the notice would remove it from their feed.
